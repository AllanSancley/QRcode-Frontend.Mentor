### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned about the "vw" and "vh" values ​​to define the total screen size. I confess that I had not yet seen these values ​​to regulate the screen size.

```css
..container {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I will dedicate myself to improving flexbox and grid, as I still have difficulties aligning items.

## Acknowledgments

I owe due thanks to the team at [Devmedia](https://www.devmedia.com.br/como-centralizar-divs-em-html-e-css/37568) as the article on screen centering was extremely important for my learning and it made me easily understand how to use screen center alignment and the use of “vw” and “vh” to scale the screen size.
